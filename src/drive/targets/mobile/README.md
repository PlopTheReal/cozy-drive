#### iOS

- Xcode >= 8.1

### :package: Install and prepare

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-drive.git
$ cd cozy-drive
$ yarn install
$ yarn genicon:drive:mobile
$ yarn build:drive:mobile
$ yarn prepare:drive:mobile
```

### :helicopter: Run

After that, you need to run to build native and js files and deploy them on the simulator :

```sh
yarn run:drive:[android || ios]
```

You can also do that manually :

On Android:

```sh
$ cd src/drive/targets/mobile
$ cordova run android
```

On iOS:

Open the src/drive/targets/mobile/platforms/ios/Cozy Drive.xcworkspace in Xcode, update the Swift syntax if needed, set your signing certificate on the target (if you're testing on a device), then:

```sh
$ npm install -g ios-deploy
$ cd src/drive/targets/mobile
$ cordova run ios
```

### :loop: Run in dev mode

Only js files are build in dev mode. So don't forget to `run` first (see the section above).

There is 3 ways to run in dev mode :

- watch with cold reload
- start with hot reload (HMR - hot module replacement)
- standalone mode

#### Watch with cold reload

```sh
$ yarn watch:drive:mobile
```

#### HMR mode on a smartphone

You need to export your local host IP address

```sh
export DEV_HOST=[YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS]
```

Then you have to watch in `hot` mode:

```sh
yarn start:drive:mobile
```

#### Standalone mode

- Open your browser with web-security CORS disabled
- launch `$ yarn start:drive:standalone`
- Go to localhost:8888 in your browser, or check the `Dev assets` in the top of the yarn console
- Follow the onboarding and after giving your cozy URL, click on the link logged in the bottom of the console
- Log yourself, accept permissions and copy the url you've been redirected to.
- Return to your previous tab and paste the url in the prompt (be quick, or take your time, whatever, because the prompt may be blocked when it pops if you're still on the permissions tab)

## :iphone: Launch the simulator

On iOS:

- Open the project in Xcode : `open "src/drive/targets/mobile/platforms/ios/Cozy Drive.xcodeproj"`
- Select "Cozy Drive" app and the device you want
- Click "Play" button

:warning: Be sure you have only one `ShareExt` in your `TARGETS` (you can check this in the main screen of Xcode)

## :lock: Create Release

### Android

Create these folders:

```
$ mkdir -p src/drive/targets/mobile/keys/android && mkdir -p src/drive/targets/mobile/build/android
```

You must have this files in `src/drive/targets/mobile/keys/android`:

- cozy-drive-release-key.jks
- key.json

:warning: You must also have the password associated with `cozy-drive-release-key.jks`

To generate a signed APK on `src/drive/targets/mobile/build/android/`

```
$ yarn buildsigned:drive:android
```

To publish on Google Play:

- Manually:
  - Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) and select `Drive` app
  - To publish an internal testing version: go to `Release > Testing > Internal testing`
  - Now you have to `Create a new release`, then `Save`, `Review release` and finally `Start rollout`

- Automatically:
  - a beta version (on beta track): `yarn publishbeta:drive:android`
  - a release version: `yarn publish:drive:android`


### iOS

Open XCode and sign in to your Apple account. This account should be part of the Cozy team with the proper access rights so you can download the Cozy Cloud signing certificates.
Once you have the certificates, change the projects signing process to use these certificates and run:

```
$ yarn publish:drive:ios
```

## :rainbow: Icons & Splashscreen

You can generate all icons with [splashicon-generator](https://github.com/eberlitz/splashicon-generator).

```sh
$ yarn genicon:drive:mobile
```

## :repeat: CI

Travis CI can automatically build a signed APK for Pull Requests. To trigger a build, simply add the text `[APK]` somewhere in the commit message.

### Icon

Should be a 1024x1024px.

- `mobile/res/model/icon.png`. On iOS add 5% margin
- `mobile/res/model/android/icon.png`. Override the default icon for the 'android' platform. So you can use an icon with alpha, as apple doesn't allow it.

### Splashscreen

Your splash must be 2732x2732px as it now is the largest resolution (used by iPad Pro 12.9"), and the artwork should fit a center square (1200x1200px). This Photoshop splash screen template provides the recommended size and guidelines of the artworkâ€™s safe zone.

- `mobile/res/model/splash.png`

## :newspaper_roll: Uploading sourcemaps to Sentry

First, you will need to create a `.sentryclirc` file in `~/` that will contain the following data:

```
[defaults]
url=https://sentry.cozycloud.cc/
project=cozy-drive-dev
org=sentry
[auth]
token = {token}
```

Replace `{token}` with a token that you can generate by going to [this page](https://sentry.cozycloud.cc/api/) (Profile -> API). The token should have the `project:write` and `project:releases` permissions.

Once the file is created, and after you've ran the proper build commands, you can upload the sourcemaps with

```sh
$ yarn sentry:drive:mobile
```
